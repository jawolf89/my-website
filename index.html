        <h2 id="favorite">My Favorite Anime Series</h2>
        <p id="home_p">Gungrave is my favorite anime series of all time, but it isn't very well known. So, I would love
            to share
            some of what makes this series so awesome starting with a list of some of the people behind the creation of
            this series as well as the video game franchise this series was based on.</p>
